# Giu [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/giu.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/giu)

An opinionated Swiss-army knife for building React application GUIs.

Online demos: [an extremely compact one](https://giu-dziantuohl.now.sh/)

## Why?

TBW: General screenshot?
TBW: Online demo: examples.js (now?)

- A use-what-you-need philosophy, especially if you use the ES6 sources and Webpack 2 (with *tree shaking*)
- Improvements over native HTML inputs: (optional) [state delegation](#inputs), [comprehensive validation](#input-validation), [native JS types and nullability](#input-value-types).
- Support for i18n: error messages, date inputs, etc.
- Love for detail:
    + [Stackable modals](#modals) with autofocus, default buttons, etc.
    + Sticky/retainable [notifications](#notifications)
    + [Keyboard shortcuts](#select) (cmd/ctrl-J, shift-up...) for options in selects and drop-down menus
    + Keyboard navigation for (almost) everything
    + Automatic scroll-into-view when inputs, even custom ones, are focused
    + Smart positioning of floating pickers (date and color inputs, drop-down menus, validation errors, etc.)
    + Ultra-customisable [date/time inputs](#dateinput)
    + Textarea with auto-resize
    + Uniform, lightweight styles with key accents that can easily be overriden
    + ... and a gorgeous [analog time picker](#dateinput)!
- Easy creation of [hint screens](#hint-screens) with dynamically-positioned labels and arrows
- Lots of [helper functions](#helpers)


## Installation

Giu is intended to be bundled with [*webpack*](https://webpack.github.io/), so it is recommended to include it in your `devDependencies`:

```
$ npm install --save-dev giu
```

Make sure you also install the required `peerDependencies` ([*react*](https://github.com/facebook/react), [*react-addons-pure-render-mixin*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-addons-pure-render-mixin) and [*moment*](https://github.com/moment/moment)).

Installation notes: 

* *moment* will not be included in your production bundle if you don't use `DateInput` and set up *webpack*'s' [*tree shaking*](http://www.2ality.com/2015/12/webpack-tree-shaking.html). However, it should be installed since *webpack* will look for it in development mode.

* Why is *moment* part of `peerDependencies` and not `dependencies`? For i18n reasons: we want to make sure the user's `moment` object and the one used internally by Giu are exactly the same, so that `DateInput`'s strings and other locale-specific attributes (e.g. first day of the week) are shown correctly. If the version specified by the user and by Giu were incompatible, we would end up with two different `moment` objects.

## Inputs

Giu provides a wide variety of inputs and several useful abstractions over native HTML native elements: state delegation (optional), comprehensive validation, JS types and nullability.

You'll understand the benefits it brings with an example. Let's say you want to build a form that allows users to modify certain parameters of their registration profile, e.g. their age. With native HTML inputs, you'd use something like this:

```js
<input type="number" id="age"
  min={0} step={1}
  value={this.state.age} onChange={age => this.setState({ age: Number(age) })}
/>
```

It seems simple, right? But in reality you are handling a lot of stuff yourself:

* You must keep track of the original `age` value in the profile (let's assume it was received as `this.props.age`), as well as the modified user value (`this.state.age`).
* You must provide an `onChange` handler and keep your state up to date.
* You must convert back and forth between the input's `string` value and your `number` attribute.
* You must validate input contents before submitting the form.

You *could* use Giu in a similar way:

```js
<NumberInput id="age" 
  min={0} step={1}
  value={this.state.age} onChange={(ev, age) => this.setState({ age })}
/>
```

This approach follows *The React Way™*, but we're already seeing a first benefit: the `onChange` handler will be called (in addition to the native event) with the *converted* input value: either a number or `null`; no need to do the conversion ourselves.

But we can further improve on this:

```js
<NumberInput ref="age" /* or: ref={c => { this.refAge = c; }}*/
  min={0} step={1}
  value={this.props.age}
  required validators={[isGte(18)]}
/>
```

What's happened here? We only pass the original age as `value`, but we delegate keeping track of the value entered by the user. We also drop the `onChange` handler and add some `validators` (see [details below](#input-validation)). When the time comes to submit the form, we can do:

```js
onClickSubmit() {
  this.refs.age.validateAndGetValue().then(age => { ... })
}
```

The promise returned by `validateAndGetValue()` will either resolve with the current value or reject if validation fails.


### Input value types

Most HTML inputs can only hold strings. Giu inputs provide you with JS types and allow `null` values by default (include the `required` flag to change that):

| Components | JS type |
| --- | --- |
| TextInput, PasswordInput, Textarea | *string* |
| NumberInput, RangeInput | *number* |
| Checkbox | *boolean* |
| DateInput | *Date* (see full range of date/time possibilities below) |
| Select, RadioGroup | *any* (depends on the values specified in the `items` prop, see below) |
| ColorInput | *string* (8-digit hex color code) |
| FileInput | *File* |


### Input validation

#### Predefined validators

Some validators are enabled by default:

```js
// Shows an error if the provided value is an invalid date.
// Will NOT complain if left blank; by default, Giu inputs can be left blank.
<DateInput />
```

![Validator screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/giu/master/docs/Validator1.png)

Validation occurs automatically when the input loses focus (i.e. on `blur`). You can also trigger it imperatively by calling `validateAndGetValue()` (see [Imperative API](#imperative-api)).

Enabling additional validators is easy:

```js
// Shows an error if left blank ('is required')
// OR if the format is not valid ('must be a valid date...').
<DateInput required />

// Shows an error only if a value is specified but it's not valid.
<TextInput validators={[isEmail()]} />
<NumberInput validators={[isGte(5), isLte(10)]} />
```

Here is the list of predefined validators, with some examples:

[[[./src/gral/validators.js]]]

As we saw above, some of these validators are automatically enabled for certain components, e.g. `isDate()` in DateInputs and `isNumber()` in NumberInputs. However, you can include them in your `validators` list for customization (e.g. i18n), as you'll see next.


#### Custom validators

Customize a predefined validator by passing it an additional argument upon instantiation. This argument can be a string or a function returning the desired error message (e.g. for i18n) based on the following arguments:

* Default error message
* Current (internal) input value
* Extra context, including the validator arguments (e.g. the `min` and `max` values for `isWithinRange`) and additional information (e.g. the expected format `fmt` for date/time values).

Some examples:

```js
// Override the message for the `isEmail` validator
<TextInput validators={[
  isEmail("please write your email address (it's safe with us!)"),
]} />

// Override the message for the `required` validator
<TextInput validators={[isRequired('please write your name')]} />

// Specify a function to further customize/translate your message
import i18n from 'mady';  // a translation function
<TextInput validators={[
  isEmail((defaultMsg, value) => i18n("'{VALUE}' is not a valid email address", { VALUE })),
]} />

// The error message function may use the extra context parameter:
<DateInput validators={[
  isDate((defaultMsg, value, { fmt }) => `follow this format: ${fmt}`),
]} />
<NumberInput validators={[
  isGte(15, (defaultMsg, value, { min }) => i18n('must be >= {MIN}', { MIN: min })),
]} />
```

You can also create your own validators, which can be synchronous (returning an error message) or asynchronous (returning a promise of an error message) and should have this signature:

* **value** *any?*: the current internal value of the input component
* **props** *object*: the input component's props (including default props)
* **context** *object?*: additional validator context provided by certain components. For example, `DateInput` injects the `moment` object via context
* **Returns** *Promise(string?)|string?*: error message

A couple of examples:

```js
// A custom sync validator
<TextInput required validators={[
  val => val.toLowerCase() === 'unicorn' ? undefined : 'must be a \'unicorn\''
]} />

// A custom async validator
<TextInput required validators={[
  val => new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => 
      val.toLowerCase() === 'unicorn'
        ? resolve()
        : resolve('checked the database; you must be a \'unicorn\'')
    , 1000)
  ),
]} />
```


### Imperative API

Giu generally follows *The React Way™*. In some particular cases, however, you may need or prefer a more imperative style:

1. Validate and fetch an input value before submitting a form
2. Move focus to an input, or away from it
3. Set an input's value (without affecting the original, reference value in the `value` prop) or revert the input state to the `value` prop

You have already seen how to accomplish task 1, via a direct component call. Assuming you keep a `ref` to the input component:

```js
onClickSubmit() {
  this.refs.age.validateAndGetValue().then(age => { ... })
}
```

This is the only truly *imperative* API provided by Giu, provided for convenience.

Tasks 2 and 3 above are managed via a *pseudo-imperative* API, the `cmds` prop, an array of commands that are executed by the so-called Input Higher-Order Component (HOC). Commands are plain objects with a `type` attribute, plus other attributes as needed. Currently supported commands are:

* `SET_VALUE`: change the current input state (without affecting the original `value` prop). The new value is passed in the command object as `value`.
* `REVERT`: revert the current input state to the original `value` prop.
* `FOCUS`, `BLUR`: move the focus to or away from the input component.

*Important note: Commands in the `cmds` prop are executed when a new array is passed down (strict equality is checked). Take this into account so that your commands are not executed more than once!*


### Common input props

* Basic (see also the [introduction to inputs](#inputs)):
    * **value** *any?*: either the original value to be modified by the user, or the current input value (if you want to manage state yourself). See also the list of [input value types](#input-value-types)
    * **onChange** *function?*: include it if you want to manage state yourself, or if you just want to be informed about user changes
    * **onFocus** *function?*
    * **onBlur** *function?*
    * **disabled** *boolean?*: prevents the input from being interacted with; also affects styles
    * **cmds** *array(object)?*: see [Imperative API](imperative-api)
* Validation-related (see also [input validation](#input-validation)):
    * **required** *boolean?*: synonym for the `isRequired()` validator
    * **validators** *array(object|function)?*: objects are used for predefined validators, whereas functions are used for custom ones
    * **noErrors** *boolean?*: ignore validation altogether
* Float-related (for all inputs with floating pickers, e.g. Select, DateInput, ColorInput):
    * **floatPosition** *string(`above`|`below`)?*: if unspecified, a suitable position is selected algorithmically
    * **floatAlign** *string(`left`|`right`)? = `left`*: if unspecified, a suitable position is selected algorithmically
    * **floatZ** *number? = 5*
* Error-float-related:
    * **errorPosition** *string(`above`|`below`)?*: if unspecified, Giu chooses `below` except if `floatPosition` is specified (it then chooses the opposite position)
    * **errorAlign** *string(`left`|`right`)? = `left`*
    * **errorZ** *number?*: if unspecified, Giu chooses a suitable z-index algorithmically


### Specific input props

#### TextInput, PasswordInput, NumberInput, RangeInput, Textarea

*Note: out of the box, Textarea resizes automatically as needed. You can limit its maximum height by adding a `style` prop: e.g. `style={{ maxHeight: 100 }}`*

[[[./src/inputs/textNumberRangeInput.js]]]

#### Checkbox

[[[./src/inputs/checkbox.js]]]

#### DateInput

Shown below are some examples of DateInput, one of Giu's most versatile components: date/time/date-time modes, with or without drop-down pickers, inline pickers, custom accent color, digital/analogue time picker, disabled style... Not shown: keyboard navigation, clipboard events.

![DateInput screenshots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/giu/master/docs/DateInputs.png)

[[[./src/inputs/dateInput.js]]]

#### Select

Shown below are some examples of Select and its features: `native` and custom (`inlinePicker`|`dropDownPicker`) versions, keyboard shortcuts, custom accent color, disabled style. Not shown: keyboard navigation, clipboard events, automatic scrolling.

![Select screenshots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guigrpa/giu/master/docs/Selects2.png)

*Recommendation: use `dropDownPicker` for performance, especially if you have hundreds/thousands of such components with many options: `native` Selects attach all of their `option` subelements to the page, whereas custom Selects only do that when the dropdown is shown.*

[[[./src/inputs/select.js]]]

#### RadioGroup

[[[./src/inputs/radioGroup.js]]]

#### ColorInput

Shown below are some examples of ColorInput and its features: inline and drop-down versions, RGB and HSV pickers, transparency slider, custom accent color, disabled style. Not shown: clipboard events.

## Hint screens

Hint screens give tips on how to use your application, through
a combination of labels (icons, images, text) and dynamically-positioned
arrows. You can show hint screens, for example, when the user reaches a
certain part of your application or performs an action for the first time.

## Tiny little things

### Button

[[[./src/components/button.js]]]

### Icon and Spinner

[[[./src/components/icon.js]]]

`Spinner` is a convenient shortcut for an `Icon` that, well, spins.

### LargeMessage

[[[./src/components/largeMessage.js]]]

### Progress

[[[./src/components/progress.js]]]


## Higher-order components (HOCs)

[HOCs](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.v1zqfc63a) are used internally by Giu components and are also provided in the user API. They work fine with all kinds of base components: [ES6 classes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#es6-classes), [plain-old `createClass`-style components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#composition-example) and [stateless functions](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions).

Example usage:

```js
import { hoverable } from 'giu';
import { Component } from 'react';

class MyReactComponent extends Component {
    /* ... */
}

export default hoverable(MyReactComponent);
```

### Hoverable HOC

## Helpers

You can find here a wide variety of helper functions, from the very simple (`cancelEvent()`, `flexContainer()`) to the relatively complex (`scrollIntoView()`). This is just an opinionated collection of hopefully useful bits and pieces for building React components.
