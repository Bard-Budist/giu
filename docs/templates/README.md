## What?

A collection of React components and utilities.
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Why?

TBW


## How?

### Installation

```
$ npm install --save-dev giu
```

It is recommended to include **giu** among your `devDependencies`, since 


### Higher-order components (HOCs)

Example usage:

```js
import { hoverable } from 'giu';
import { Component } from 'react';

class MyReactComponent extends Component {
    /* ... */
}

export default hoverable(MyReactComponent);
```

HOCs also work fine with functional React components.
