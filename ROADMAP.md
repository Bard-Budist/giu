- [x] Change error color to yellow when changed
- [x] Show errors on inputs
- [x] DateTimePicker: DatePicker, TimePickerDigital, TimePickerAnalogue
- [x] DateInput
- [x] FileInput
- [x] Select: `native`, `inlinePicker`, `dropDownPicker`
- [x] Dropdown menu: should register its keys
- [x] DateInput
- [ ] Make input styles more homogeneous, minimal:
    + [ ] Disabled means no border (not dimmed), no reaction to clicks, no `pointer` cursor, obviously not focusable. Missing: inline pickers
    + [x] Input borders, font family, font size, padding, etc.
- [ ] Add validation hook to inputs; return an error or an array of errors
- [ ] RadioButton

- [ ] ColorInput + ColorPicker
- [ ] Hints
- [ ] Pressing enter on button opening a modal also dismisses the modal!
- [ ] Add alternative style to inputs (no borders, etc.) or make it simple to wrap the provided components and customise
- [ ] Multi-selection ListPicker:
- [ ] Design customisation strategy for theme constants (context? constant modification?) -- reduce to the minimum the style-related props (one color), so that we don't need to handle that!
- [ ] Drag and drop
- [ ] Include SVG font?
- [ ] DOCS!
