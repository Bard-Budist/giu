# giu [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/giu.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/giu)

## What?

A collection of React components and utilities.
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Why?

- Flexibility:
    + If you use the ES6 sources and Webpack 2, you can bundle only the components you need, nothing more. For example, if you `import Modal`, you will not embed Redux, which you will if you `import Modals`.
    + If you need a simple confirmation modal, use `Modal` directly. If you need stacked modals and more state control, include a `Modals` component at the top of your app and use the provided API. If you need even more control, use the exported `modalReducer` and `modalActions` (action creators) with your own application's Redux store. Same for `Notifications`and `Floats`.
    + In form components (`TextInput`, `Select`, `Textarea`...), choose whether you want giu to handle state for you (and then retrieve the component's value when e.g. the user clicks on Submit) or you want full control from outside.
    + Styles: lightweight styles are included for some components, but you can always customise the appearance including your own `style` attributes.
- Nice touches:
    + Textarea with auto-resize
    + Keyboard shortcuts, autofocus, default buttons on Modals
    + Sticky/retainable notifications
- Completeness:
    + Basic components: Button, Icon, Spinner, LargeMessage...
    + Form components: TextInput, NumberInput, Select, Textarea, Checkbox...
    + Not-so-basic ones: Modal(s), Notification(s)...
    + Higher-order components: Hoverable
    + Style helpers: ...
    + Other helpers: ...

## How?

### Installation

```
$ npm install --save-dev giu
```

Make sure you also install the required `peerDependencies` (`react`, `react-addons-pure-render-mixin` and `moment`). Regarding `moment`, it will not be a part of your production bundle if you don't use the `DateInput` component and set up [*tree shaking*](http://www.2ality.com/2015/12/webpack-tree-shaking.html).

Installation notes: 

* It is recommended to include **giu** among your `devDependencies`, since you should bundle it with your application using Webpack.

* Why is `moment` part of `peerDependencies` and not `dependencies`? For i18n reasons: we want to make sure the user's `moment` object and the one used by `giu` internally are exactly the same, so that `DateInput`'s strings are shown in the correct language (and the correct start-of-week is used).


### Higher-order components (HOCs)

Example usage:

```js
import { hoverable } from 'giu';
import { Component } from 'react';

class MyReactComponent extends Component {
    /* ... */
}

export default hoverable(MyReactComponent);
```

HOCs also work fine with functional React components.

#### Hoverable

Keeps track of `hovering` state and passes it as prop to your base
component. Provides `onHoverStart`/`onHoverStop` event handlers
you can attach to any of your base component's DOM elements
(works for multiple elements).
If you attach these handlers to an element with an `id` attribute,
the provided `hovering`
prop will contain the ID of the hovered element (or `null`); otherwise,
just `true` (or `null`).

Specific props received from the parent (all other props are
passed through):

* **onHoverStart** *function?*: relays the original event to
  the parent component.
* **onHoverStop** *function?*: relays the original event to
  the parent component.

Additional props passed to the base component:

* **hovering** *string|number|boolean?*: identifies the
  element that is hovered (see description above), or `null` if none
* **onHoverStart** *function*: `onMouseEnter` event handler you can attach to
  your target DOM elements
* **onHoverStop** *function*: `onMouseLeave` event handler you can attach to
  your target DOM elements


### Input validation

In its most basic form, you don't need to do anything to validate some components:

```js
import { DateInput } from 'giu';
// Will complain if the provided value is not a correctly formatted date.
// Will NOT complain if left blank; by default, giu inputs can be left blank
<DateInput />
```

It is also very simple to add predefined validators to a component:

```js
// Will complain ('is required') if left blank.
// Will also complain ('must be a valid date...') if the format is not valid
<DateInput required />
<TextInput required validators={[isEmail()]} />
<NumberInput required validators={[isGte(5), isLte(10)]} />
```

Here is the list of predefined validators, with some examples:

```js
// Generic
isRequired()
isEqualTo(password, 'password')
isOneOf(['rabbit', 'cow', 'eagle'])

// Strings
hasAtLeastChars(5)
hasAtMostChars(20)
hasLengthWithinRange(5, 20)
isEmail()
isUrl()
matchesPattern(/[-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+/)

// Numbers
isNumber()
isGreaterThanOrEqual(0) // or: isGte(0)
isLowerThanOrEqual(1000) // or: isLte(1000)
isWithinRange(0, 1000)

// Dates and times
isDate()
```

Some of these validators are automatically enabled for certain components, e.g. `isDate()` in `DateInput`s and `isNumber()` in `NumberInput`s, so you don't need to include them in the `validators` list (except if you want to customize/translate the error message).

In order to customize a predefined validator, include an additional argument when instantiating it, as in the following examples:

```js
// Override the message for the `isEmail` validator
<TextInput validators={[isEmail('please leave your email')]} />
// Specify a function to further customize your message
<TextInput 
  validators={[
    isEmail((defaultMsg, value) => `are you sure '${value}' is an email?`),
  ]} 
/>
// Override the message for the `required` validator
<DateInput validators={[isRequired('please specify a date!')]} />
```

### Helpers

#### Styles

**flexContainer()**

Provides an inline style object for a Flex container.

* **flexDirection** *string(`row`|`column`)? = `row`*
* **style** *object?*: custom style (merged with the Flex style)
* **Returns** *object*: Flex container style

**flexItem()**

Provides an inline style object for a Flex item.

* **flex** *string|number*: value for the CSS `flex`/`-webkit-flex` attribute
* **style** *object?*: custom style (merged with the Flex style)
* **Returns** *object*: Flex item style

**boxWithShadow()**

Provides an inline style object for a slightly rounded shadowed box.

* **style** *object?*: custom style (merged with the base style)
* **Returns** *object*: inline style

**isDark()/isLight()**

Determines whether the provided color is perceived as dark or light.
Can be used to decide whether text on this background color should be light
or dark, respectively, for good readability.

* **color** *string/Color*: parameter describing the color (anything that
  can be processed by [tinycolor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor))
* **Returns** *bool*: whether the color is dark (light)

**darken()/lighten()**

Darkens or lightens a given color by a given percentage.

* **color** *string/Color*: parameter describing the color (anything that
  can be processed by [tinycolor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor))
* **percentage** *number? = 10*: percentage by which the color will be modified
* **Returns** *string*: hex string for the new color, e.g. `#ffaadd`

**addStylesToPage()**

Creates a new `<style>` component with the provided CSS styles and
attaches it to the page.

* **styles** *string*: CSS styles to be added to the page

#### Miscellaneous

**bindAll()**

Binds a list of object methods to the object with `Function.prototype.bind()`.
Especially useful for React components with ES6 syntax.

* **_this** *object*: methods will be bound to this object
* **fnNames** *array<string>*: list of method names

**cancelEvent()**

Calls `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` on the provided event.

* **ev** *object?*: event to be cancelled

**preventDefault()**

Calls `preventDefault()` on the provided event.

* **ev** *object?*: event for which default behaviour is to be prevented

**cancelBodyScrolling()**

`onWheel` event handler that can be installed on a scroller DOM node,
in order to prevent `wheel` events to cause document scrolling when
the scroller reaches the top/bottom of its contents.

* **ev** *object*: `wheel` event object

**windowHeightWithoutScrollbar()/windowWidthWithoutScrollbar()**

Provides the inner height (width) of the window without
any scrollbars that may currently be displayed.

* **Returns** *number*: inner height (width) in pixels

**getScrollbarWidth()**

Measures and returns the scrollbar width for the current browser.

The scrollbar width is measured lazily when first requested.
On window `resize`, it is measured again (zooming causes
the reported widths to change, and the `resize` event is a
reliable way to detect zooming).
Note that the returned value might be zero,
e.g. on OS X with overlaid scrollbars.

* **Returns** *number*: scrollbar width in pixels
