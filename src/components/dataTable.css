/* Important transition, no only aesthetically. When a row's contents changes height
and it is not shown because it is above the viewport, wheneve the user scrolls up
to that row it will get rendered, report on its new height, and all of the subsequent
rows will get repositioned. This should happen slowly to avoid confusing jumps
while scrolling */
